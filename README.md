# Study Projects - Bsc

Projects that i did during my BSC in Statistics and Data Science @ [HUJI](https://stat.huji.ac.il/).


Note that ive rendered most of the Rmarkdown files to .MD files to see it nicely inside github.

The most interesting coureses with projects you should view are:
1. **Big data mining** - 
  Main topics of this course was Unix, scraping methods, advanced SQL, Distributed computing in a cloud environment, analyzing network data.
[Final assignment](https://github.com/yonatanlou/study_projects_bsc/tree/main/BigDataMining/final_assignment).

2.  **Object oriented programming (Java)** - Main  topics of this course was get to know the principles of the Object Oriented Programming paradigm, Java programming and advanced programming skills . 
Projects: 
	- [Bricker game](https://github.com/yonatanlou/study_projects_bsc/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20OOP/Bricker).
	- [AsciiArt](https://github.com/yonatanlou/study_projects_bsc/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20OOP/AsciiArtEx6_)
	- [WorldSimulation](https://github.com/yonatanlou/study_projects_bsc/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20OOP/pepse)
3. **Statistical Learning and data analysis** - Really interesting course that covered most of the topics in ISLR and in [Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/) by Shalizi. 
Projects:
	- [Car accidents analysis](https://github.com/yonatanlou/study_projects_bsc/blob/main/Statistical_learning_and_data%20analysis/lab1/Lab1.pdf) -EDA and PCA.
	- [fMri data](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yonatanlou/study_projects_bsc/blob/main/Statistical_learning_and_data%20analysis/lab3/Lab3.html#prediction-model) - Kernel regression, regularization methods, image analysis.
	- [Forest Cover Type](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yonatanlou/study_projects_bsc/blob/main/Statistical_learning_and_data%20analysis/final_lab/Final_lab.html) - Naive bayes (raw implementation), feature engineering, classifiers (XGboost, svm, RandomForest and more). 
4. **Statistics lab** - Using statistical methods to analyze election data in Israel.
	Projects:
	- [Anomaly detection with election data](https://github.com/yonatanlou/study_projects_bsc/blob/main/Statistics_lab/labs/Lab7.ipynb).
5. **Simulations in statistics** - Learning about advanced simulation methods in statistiscs as MCMC, Bootstrap, ABC, Baysien analysis, Control variates, sampling.
	Projects:
	-  [All exercises](https://github.com/yonatanlou/study_projects_bsc/tree/main/simulations_in_statistics)
	- [Decrypting Ciphertext Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://github.com/yonatanlou/Decrypting-Classical-Cipher-Text-Using-MCMC).
6. **Urban simulation** - Simulate the spread of the Covid19 with OOP and geographical models.
